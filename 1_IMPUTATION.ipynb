    "We suspect that some columns (for example, Annual_Income, Monthly_Inhand_Salary, Num_Bank_Accounts, Num_Credit_Card, Interest_Rate, and Num_of_Loan) should remain constant over the 8 monthly records for each customer. However, there is a possibility that for some columns (such as Monthly_Inhand_Salary) the values might change from month to month. \n",

The code below groups the data by Customer_ID and computes the number of unique values for each candidate column obviously excluding the missing values. This allows us to calculate the percentage of customers that have more than one unique value per column. It also signals the customers for which there is an high variation in the values of the column."
